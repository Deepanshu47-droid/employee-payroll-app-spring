🚀 Use Case 6: Implementing Lombok for Getters and Setters

Objective

In this use case, we optimize the Employee Payroll application by using Lombok to generate getters, setters, constructors, and other boilerplate code automatically.

Key Features Implemented

✔️ Lombok Integration: Eliminates the need for manually writing getters, setters, constructors, etc.

✔️ Simplified DTO Class: Uses Lombok annotations to handle getters, setters, and constructors.

✔️ Reduces Boilerplate Code: Makes the code cleaner and more maintainable.

Steps to Implement

1️⃣ Add Lombok Dependency to pom.xml

Ensure that Lombok is included in the project dependencies.

2️⃣ Install Lombok in Your IDE

🔹 For IntelliJ IDEA

Install the Lombok Plugin from the plugin marketplace.

Enable "Annotation Processing" in settings.

Restart IntelliJ & rebuild the project.

🔹 For Eclipse

Download and run the Lombok JAR to install it in Eclipse.

Restart Eclipse & rebuild the project.

🔹 For VS Code

Install the "Lombok Annotations Support" extension from the VS Code Marketplace.

Restart VS Code & rebuild the project.

3️⃣ Modify DTO and Entity Classes

Remove manually written getters, setters, and constructors.

Use Lombok annotations to handle these automatically.

4️⃣ Update Controller to Use Lombok-based DTO

Modify the controller to utilize the Lombok-optimized DTO and entity classes.

Testing Lombok Functionality

✅ Check if Lombok is Working

After applying Lombok, verify that the getters and setters are generated automatically and can be accessed without explicitly defining them.

Expected Outcome

🎯 Faster Development: No need to manually write getters, setters, or constructors.

🎯 Cleaner Code: Reduces unnecessary boilerplate code.

🎯 Improved Maintainability: Future modifications become easier.
