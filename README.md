📌 UC4: Introducing Service Layer in Employee Payroll App

🏗 Overview

In UC4, we introduce the Service Layer to separate business logic from the controller. Previously, the controller was responsible for handling both incoming requests and business logic. Now, the service layer will manage the Employee Model while the controller delegates tasks to it.

⚡ Key Updates

✔ Service Layer Introduction: Handles business logic separately.

✔ Dependency Injection: Uses @Autowired to inject the service into the controller.

✔ Controller Refactoring: Delegates model handling to the service instead of managing it directly.

🔧 Changes in API Endpoints

HTTP Method	Endpoint	Description

POST	/employees/service/create	Creates a new employee using the service layer.

GET	/employees/service/get/{name}/{salary}	Fetches an employee using the service layer.

🎯 Benefits of Service Layer

✅ Improved Code Maintainability: Separation of concerns makes it easier to manage.

✅ Reusability: Service logic can be reused across different parts of the application.

✅ Scalability: Future enhancements become easier with a structured architecture.
