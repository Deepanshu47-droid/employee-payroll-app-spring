UC16 - Developing Full CRUD Operations for Employee Payroll with MySQL

üìå Overview

This use case focuses on implementing full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for Employee Payroll data using MySQL as the database.

‚úÖ Steps to Implement

1Ô∏è‚É£ Create API to Get All Employees

Develop a GET endpoint to fetch all employee records.

Use employeeRepository.findAll() to retrieve data from the database.

Return a list of employees as a JSON response.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Create API to Get Employee by ID

Develop a GET endpoint that takes an employee ID as a path variable.

Use employeeRepository.findById(id) to fetch employee details.

Return the employee data if found, else handle EmployeeNotFoundException.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Create API to Add New Employee

Develop a POST endpoint to save a new employee record.

Validate the input using annotations like @Valid.

Use employeeRepository.save(employee) to store the data.

Return the saved employee details as a response.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Create API to Update Employee Details

Develop a PUT endpoint to update an existing employee.

Fetch the employee by ID and update fields like name, department, gender, etc.

Use employeeRepository.save(updatedEmployee) to persist changes.

Return the updated employee details.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Create API to Delete Employee

Develop a DELETE endpoint to remove an employee by ID.

Use employeeRepository.deleteById(id) to delete the record.

Return a success message upon successful deletion.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Implement Exception Handling

Use @RestControllerAdvice to handle exceptions like EmployeeNotFoundException.

Return proper error messages when invalid IDs are requested.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Test API Endpoints

Use Postman or a REST client to test CRUD operations.

Validate responses and ensure data is updated correctly in the MySQL database.

Verify database changes using SQL queries.

üéØ Expected Outcome

The API should support all CRUD operations with MySQL.

Proper validation and error handling should be implemented.

Employee records should be correctly stored, retrieved, updated, and deleted from the database.
