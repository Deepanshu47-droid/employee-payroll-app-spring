📝 UC14: Payroll DTO Validations

📌 Overview

In this update, we ensure proper validation for the Payroll DTO fields:

✅ gender

✅ startDate

✅ note

✅ profilePic

✅ department

These validations apply to both Create and Update REST API calls.

🛠️ Implemented Validations

1️⃣ Gender Validation 🧑‍💼

Must be "Male" or "Female" (other values are rejected).

2️⃣ Start Date Validation 📅

Uses @JsonFormat(pattern = "dd MMM yyyy") to handle date conversion.

Must be past or present (future dates are not allowed).

3️⃣ Note & Profile Picture Validation 🖼️

Cannot be blank (@NotBlank).

Profile Picture must be a valid URL.

4️⃣ Department Validation 🏢

Must be non-empty.

🔹 Logging Enhancements

🔹 Added @Slf4j logging to both the Controller and Service layers for better debugging.

🔍 Example of a Valid JSON Request

{
"name": "Deepanshu Malviya",
"gender": "Male",
"startDate": "15 Feb 2024",
"note": "Hardworking and dedicated employee",
"profilePic": "https://example.com/profile-pic.jpg",
"department": ["Engineering", "Cloud Computing"]
}

❌ Handling Validation Errors

If any field fails validation, a structured error response is returned:

{
"timestamp": "2025-02-28T10:30:45",
"status": 400,
"error": "Bad Request",
"message": "Validation failed. Please check the errors field for details.",
"errors": {
"gender": "Gender must be either Male or Female",
"startDate": "Date must be past or present"
}
}
